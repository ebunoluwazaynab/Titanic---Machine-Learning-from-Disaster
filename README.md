# Titanic---Machine-Learning-from-Disaster
#### This project uses machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck with 0.78468 score on the leaderboard. 

The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.
While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.
In this project, I will build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).
What Data Will I Use in This Competition?

I will use 2 similar datasets that include passenger information like name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc. One dataset is titled `train_titanic.csv` and the other is titled `test_titanic.csv`. The train_titanic.csv contains the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 to be exact) and importantly, the target variable to know if the passengers survived or not. The `test_titanic.csv` dataset contains similar information but does not disclose the if the passenger survived or not. 
Using the patterns I find in the train_titanic.csv data, I will predict whether the other 418 passengers on board (found in test_titanic.csv) survived.

This is a kaggle competition and can be found here.
